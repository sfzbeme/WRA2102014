  <h1>Module 11</h1>
<h3> Scrum Team Experience</h3>
<p>My scrum team was pretty laid back, and we generally did not bring many problems to the group for them to help us solve. This was a good thing since we were all busy, but a little disappointing because it felt like I could not bring some problems to my team for help. However, our team was very helpful in helping me solve some design problems, such as what to put in my header and how to arrange some of my pages. I provided support by showing Stephan how to do the gradient background, and referred Emily to CodePen. She had been having some trouble previewing her site, so stealing this resource helped her greatly. </p>
<h3> Time Spent in Workshops </h3>
<p>Honestly, we did not spend our time very well in the workshop time. I think the cause of this was the fact that we are all juniors in project-heavy majors, so wanted to spend that time working on other things. That said, I think the time we were there was spent well discussing design choices and how to effectively separate our design from content. I basically set one huge milestone of having my site developed enough to present by my presentation, and worked on it daily until it was at that point. It seemed to work out. I plan on making slight tweaks to my code from now until it is due next week. </p>
<p>In the future, I should probably make more of an effort to set deadlines and stick to them. When I have more time in my schedule, this is what I plan to do. Having a set time when I will have my landing page done, analyze my CSS, and make sure the site works as a whole would be extremely helpful. Even though it has worked out so far this time, it may not work as well in the future to wing it as much as I did, so I need to set better goals. </p>
<h3> Where I Got Support</h3>
<p>Most of my support was from you in class, or from Google. I used Google to find out how to do the two toughest things on my site: gradient backgrounds and pop-up boxes. I also frequently referred back to Codeacademy, to refresh my memory on different techniques. Finally, my friend Jessica Link was a great resource, as she is in the advanced version of our class right now. </p>
<p>I think one thing I could do to improve my process would be to check in with instructors or experts step by step in my code. I tend to like to work in large chunks, and ignore the tweaks that need to be made in the middle of those chunks. Next time I attempt a project like this, I should take time between these large chunks of work to analyze and improve. This will help me have a better product at the end, and keep me dedicated to a set timeline more. I could have done this well with you or the scrum groups in class, but neglected it a little bit. Next time, I will be sure to take advantage of the resources available, especially when I am feeling as overwhelmed as I did. </p>
